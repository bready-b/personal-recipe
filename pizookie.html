  <h2>Description:</h2>
  <p>Yes, you can have a pizookie without heating up the oven! This air fryer recipe is simple, delicious, and really good if you just need something low-effort but satisfying. Top with gelato, whipped cream, and a drizzle of melted chocolate, or anything you like.</p>
 
  <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>5 pieces pre-cut refrigerated chocolate chip cookie dough (such as Pillsbury™ Ready to Bake!™ Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough)</li>
  <br>
  <li>1 scoop vanilla gelato (optional)</li>
  <br>
  <li>2 tablespoons whipped cream, or as needed (optional)</li>
  <br>
  <li>1 ounce chocolate, melted, to drizzle (optional)</li>
</ul>


<h2>Steps To Make:</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Preheat the air fryer to 360 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
    <br>
    <li>Get a large piece of aluminum foil and fold it into an 8x8-inch square. You can make a little dish out of the foil by folding the edges upward.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Place 1 piece of cookie dough in the middle of your foil. Arrange remaining cookie dough pieces around it in a pattern similar to the 5-side of a die.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Bake cookie in the air fryer for 6 minutes. Open the air fryer and gently push down the top of the cookie; continue to bake until deep golden brown, 2 to 4 minutes more.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Add gelato, whipped cream, and a drizzle of melted chocolate, and enjoy!</li>
